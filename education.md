## Researcher at Foxconn AI.

From 2021 to present, I have been leading self-supervised learning projects at Foxconn AI. In this role, I have been responsible for developing and implementing cutting-edge self-supervised learning algorithms, designing experiments to evaluate their effectiveness, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to apply these models to real-world problems. Additionally, I have provided technical guidance and mentorship to junior team members, and have contributed to the company's research and development roadmap. My work at Foxconn AI has allowed me to gain deep expertise in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, and has given me invaluable experience in developing solutions for real-world problems using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

In September 2020, I embarked on an exciting academic journey towards a Ph.D. degree. As a participant in National Central University's tech and innovation initiative, I've had the opportunity to flex my creative muscles, cultivate patience, and nurture a deep passion for design. This experience has also taught me how to overcome adversity and become more resilient. Thanks to NCU, I've discovered my true passions and have been surrounded by a community of inspiring peers who have helped shape my academic journey.

I am thrilled to embark on a new chapter of my journey at NCU-Delta Machine Learning Vision Research Lab. As a driven, passionate, and exceptional researcher, I am eager to contribute my skills and efforts towards the development of innovative solutions. My goal is to make significant strides in the field of machine learning and computer vision, and I am excited to be a part of such an innovative and forward-thinking team.

#Efficient ML for embedded applications is Integrating ML applications for health care and security((biometric recognition) and civil infrastructure applications on embedded device's l. 
#TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance- and power-constrained domain of tiny devices and embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires intimate knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software.

I am grateful for the opportunity to spend the past two years away from home. During this time, I have honed my ability to articulate my ideas, discipline myself, and think critically. I have also come to appreciate the importance of a solid foundation in math, physics, and computer science. Most importantly, I have had the privilege of working alongside many exceptional and diverse friends from different countries, which has taught me the value of teamwork and collaboration. 



## B.S  in Earth Science, earned July/2017
