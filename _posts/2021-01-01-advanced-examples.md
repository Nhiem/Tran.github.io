## Collaborative and Independents Research

While at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The diverse topics include science, engineering, mathematics, program languages, and many others that foundation for my current and future research. Research has unquestionably been the most important and rewarding component of my education.  It also has proven to be a fantastic supplement to my undergraduate, and graduate-level. Learning, exploring, and innovating are strengths conceptual understanding of the material taught in science classes in my academics performance. Now myself has become more involved in research outside of the classroom.




### I. Iris Recognition on IoTs, Embedded, Mobiles Applications ( 01/2021 Ð 07/2021)

This project aims to ensure robust security for all devices, authorization, and authentication are the critically important factor to strongly against the vulnerability or attack from the internet to billions of our embedded mobiles and IoT devices now much more asynchronously integrated through the internet.

#### Project development of both software and firmware: 

**1. In software:** 

we propose the novel iris recognition algorithm which is increased the robustness performance to overcome the limitation such as the requirement of the expensive image acquisition devices or requirement of well control environmental conditions, the highly expensive computation using deep learning, and the most important is the adaptable transfer of the algorithm in different applications

+ **Novel algorithm proposal.** 

The End-to-End iris recognition pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. The first part of the pipeline is the new deep decoder-encoder architecture base convolution neural network that generates iris segmentation and iris mask. The iris segmentation determines the inner and outer boundary of the iris, and the generated iris mask is used to select the iris and eliminate the non-iris region. The second part of the pipeline highlight two different approaches for extracting the Iris pattern,(1) the method is based on the traditional approach include the Gabo filter method. (2) the method based on deep learning by design FCN (Fully convolution model) is combined with the convolution attention module.Third, the identification between multiple IrisCodes evaluate by using Harming distance;

+ Collaborative Optimization Algorithm 

In this study, we develop a collaborative optimization technique for iris recognition as shown in Figure 2, the method with combining various techniques. This includes model weight pruning, clustering, and quantization during training. Our main goal is to reduce the memory footprint, and complexity of the model needed to run large neural networks of inference on a device with limited memory, storage, and power.

We deploy the modelâ€™s collaborative optimizing weight pruning technique to eliminate the redundant connection while retaining meaning and informational connection, and followed by applying weight clustering which will share the same weight across multiple connections. Eventually, the quantization aware training applied from the int4, int8 bit precision quantization is deployed during the training.

**2. In firmware:** 

The first primary open-source hardware platform for the iris recognition, it will serve as the educational platform second it will be the foundation for the future development of iris recognition application in IoTs, and mobiles applications.
