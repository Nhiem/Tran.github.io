## Collaborative and Independents Research

While at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The diverse topics include science, engineering, mathematics, program languages, and many others that foundation for my current and future research. Research has unquestionably been the most important and rewarding component of my education.  It also has proven to be a fantastic supplement to my undergraduate, and graduate-level. Learning, exploring, and innovating are strengths conceptual understanding of the material taught in science classes in my academics performance. Now myself has become more involved in research outside of the classroom.



### II. Eye_tracking eLearning Applications ( 09/2020 -- Present)

#### Collaborative Research -- Network Learning Technology (NCU)

This project uses an advanced algorithm and customized eyeglasses to study the visual behavior for eLearning training and the physical classroom. The project captures and analyses the user's visual behavior objectively and precisely. In our study, we primarily focus on understanding the cognitive processes underlying a variety of student behavior. This project can reveal patterns of learning and social interactions, it also enables the screening of typical neurological development and cognitive or perceptual disability.


####  Project development of both Advance Algorithm and Hardware: 

1. Eye_tracking glasses: 

Eye_tracking glasses are ideal for studying behavior in real-world situation. Which can be use objectively and accurately record and analyze visual behavior of human visual behavior, in our study we primary focus on eLearning application eye tracking glass as design demonstrate in figure the crucial important to study movements of participant’s eyes in classroom and event in web browsing and others related of student visual focusing. This gives insight into the cognitive processes underlying a wide variety of student behavior and can reveal things such as learning patters and social interaction, It also allows for the screening of typical neurodevelopment and cognitive or perceptual disability.

'''
     You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

    [Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

    $$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

    The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

    $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

    The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

    $$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

    ## Code

    Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

    {% highlight c %}

    static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
    {
        struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
        int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
        Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
        Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
    }

    {% endhighlight %}

    ## Gists

    With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

    ## Images

    Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

    A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

    ## Embedded content

    You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

## III. Integrated TDR monitoring system on physical modelling for disaster prevention. (08/2019-07/2020) 

Research and Experiment Conducted on Centrifuge Machine in National Central University 

**NCU Centrifuge Maching**
<img src= "https://github.com/Nhiem/tran.github.io/blob/master/_posts/IMGP8079.JPG?raw=true" width="700" /> 
                                                                                                
This study proposed the development embedded TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) system integrated with centrifuge reverse fault physical modeling to simulate sliding at depth to simulate the shear plane in the centrifuge modeling at the different earth gravity levels. 
The prototype model can investigate through the 1/N scale model by enhancing the N time level earth gravity field.

### Design & Integreate Embedded TDR DAQ integreate with Centrifuge DAQ System

+	**Centrifuge DAQ System**

The centrifuge DAQ system, as shown in Fig.1, consists of the control mounted PC, Ethernet switch, WDM converter, fiber optic rotary joint, NI PCI-6250 card, and NI SCXI modules (National Instruments). The mounted SRC-200 PC is an x86 compatible computer manufactured by Small PC Inc. The NI PCI-6250 card is a multi-function data acquisition board installed in the mounted PC. The NI SCXI modules container which mounts on the centrifuge contains 4 types of modules for various measuring purpose. The SCXI-1531 is an 8-channel accelerometer input module. The SCXI-1520 is an 8-channel universal strain gauge input module which also builds on 350 ohms resistances. The SCXI-1540 is an 8-channel linear-voltage differential transformer. (LVDT) module. The SCXI-1102C is a 32-channel voltage meter module amplifier. 

+ **TDR DAQ**	

The 8-channel Line Impedance Analyzer TDR1500x8 SYMPULS is shown in Fig 3 (a). The impedance analyzer TDR 1500x8 with a multiplexer is used for precise analysis of various lines. TDR 1500x8 shows directly the line impedance as a function of the propagation time or the distance. The variation of the impedance of a given line is shown in the form of an oscillogram directly on the personal computer. The reﬂections and transitions are displayed directly and can be analyzed with accuracy to millimeters. The combination of a fast pulse generator and sampling scope leads to a system-rise time of less than 200ps. The TDR1500x8 uses a fully digital time-base that makes it unsusceptible to environmental changes.

Fig 2 Diagram shown TDR DAQ configure in centrifuge DAQ system.



TDR impedance analyzer is embedded in centrifuge DAQ system by connecting with computer PA-2000 by connecting through USB protocol port as shown in Fig.2 The system can access the TDR console in the control room, and utilize the LabVIEW program to launch the acquisition sequence at the mounted PC through the remote desktop program. LabVIEW program was written for continuous taking TDR waveform reflection during testing, and the program interface is shown in Fig.3. (b).

## My thoughts 
**“Research is something that everyone can do, and everyone ought to do. It is simply collecting information and thinking systematically about it.” - Raewyn Connell**

**I believe in innovation and that the way you get innovation is you fund research, Committing myself to the world of scientific research has instilled an investigative mindset and a passion for the scientific process, and an appreciation for the results of engineering design and Innovate.**
